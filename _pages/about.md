I am currently a PhD candidate in Computer Engineering at Polytechnique Montreal (Canada). In July 2019, I obtained an engineering degree with honors in industrial computing and automation from the National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology INSAT (Tunisia). Because of my past engineering internships in Berlin (Germany), I have hands-on experience in embedded software development with a good knowledge in electronics and hardware design.

My doctoral research project is about the privacy and the security of deep learning algorithms implemented in embedded systems. My interests focus on improving the robustness of Deep Neural Networks and protect them from malicious attacks.

Aside from work, I enjoy going for long walks, cycling and going to gym. I also like cooking and spending quality time with my friends. I must say that I am passionate about technology and I love building robots as well as smart embedded systems.
